BENSON'S HOLE,http://www.swimmingholes.org/vt.html,,43.16497,-73.03922,"Though very close to RT 7, Benson's Hole is a little tricky to get to. RT 11 and RT 30 combine and the road winds through the Manchester area. From RT 7 take exit 4 and travel east on RT 11/30 for approximately 0.25 miles. Take a sharp, hairpin right turn onto East Manchester Road just as RT 11\30 begins to curve left and heads in a northerly direction. It can be very easy to miss this turn. East Manchester Road heads south then bends right to head in a westerly direction. In about 0.3 miles from the bend, you will need to bear left at the fork in the road to remain on East Manchester Road. If you stay straight here, you will be on Peace Road, which is a dead end and not where you want to be. After the fork, take your second left onto Glen Road and park near the small bridge that crosses Bromley Brook. Follow the shoreline downstream to the swimming area.",
BOLTON POTHOLES,http://www.swimmingholes.org/vt.html,,44.37554,-72.87605,"How to get there : From Waterbury, follow RT 2 west approximately 6.5 miles from the intersection of RT 2 and RT 100 in Waterbury. Take a right onto Bolton Valley Road. The parking area is 0.25 miles on the right.

How to act when you are there : Be careful when you are parking or pulling out of the parking spots. The dirt and gravel are very loose and spinouts accelerate erosion. Do not use the driveways on private property to park or turn around. (Would you want hundreds of people turning around in your driveway every weekend?) Use your own bathroom before you visit. This beautiful swimming hole is heavily used and simply cannot accommodate the bathroom needs of a crowd. Yes, it is a natural thing, but when so many people leave their waste here, it turns this bucolic place into a cesspool. If you cannot find a safe place to park, try visiting one of the other swimming holes in Vermont that are listed on this page.",

Approximately 0.4 miles past Cavendish, watch on the right side of Rte 131 for a small waste water treatment facility near or beside a small, moderately well maintained dirt road labeled CVPS road. Turn right onto CVPS Rd and follow to a small parking area on the left. There is a gate (usually locked) at the entrance to the power plant., but if found unlocked, do NOT be tempted to park inside the gate. walk past the gate, (be respectful now since you are on power plant property) past the power plant, and follow a grassy path up hill and up river. To your left will be the gorge, although views from the rim will only occasionally reveal much of the gorge below. Continue approximately 0.4 miles upstream almost all the way to the dam, and find natural breaks in the gorge wall to enter into the gorge. ",
CONGDON'S POINT ,http://www.swimmingholes.org/vt.html,,43.71482,-72.90536,"From the intersection of RT 4 and RT 7 in the center of Rutland, follow US 7 north for approximately 5.25 miles and take a right onto Sangamon Hill Road. Follow this road until it ends, then take a left on East Pittsford Road. This road becomes Main Street just past the left turn off for Powerhouse Road. Staying on Main Street, you will enter the center of Chittenden. Mountain Top Road will lead off to the left. Stay straight and this road is now Chittenden Dam Road. Follow the road about 2 miles until you see a sign and road for the boat ramp on the right side, at this point you will be at the foot of the concrete spillway. Turn right up the boat launch road to the parking area at the dam.

The trail to Congdon's Point begins about a tenth of a mile or so behind the bar gate to the right at the top of the boat ramp. The trail goes left from this old woods road, passes two coves and a large boulder. Keep the water in sight, as the trail may be a little confusing north of the boulder. Congdon's Point is the third and outermost point from the boat ramp. Nude swimmers and sunbathers have been enjoying this spot for years. ",
