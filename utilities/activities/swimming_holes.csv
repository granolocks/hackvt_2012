ADAMS HOLE ,http://www.swimmingholes.org/vt.html,,44.34333,-72.06111,"From St. Johnsbury, go south on RT 5 and turn west (right) on Joe's Brook Road about 2 miles before East Barnet.

BENSON'S HOLE,http://www.swimmingholes.org/vt.html,,43.16497,-73.03922,"Though very close to RT 7, Benson's Hole is a little tricky to get to. RT 11 and RT 30 combine and the road winds through the Manchester area. From RT 7 take exit 4 and travel east on RT 11/30 for approximately 0.25 miles. Take a sharp, hairpin right turn onto East Manchester Road just as RT 11\30 begins to curve left and heads in a northerly direction. It can be very easy to miss this turn. East Manchester Road heads south then bends right to head in a westerly direction. In about 0.3 miles from the bend, you will need to bear left at the fork in the road to remain on East Manchester Road. If you stay straight here, you will be on Peace Road, which is a dead end and not where you want to be. After the fork, take your second left onto Glen Road and park near the small bridge that crosses Bromley Brook. Follow the shoreline downstream to the swimming area.",
BOLTON POTHOLES,http://www.swimmingholes.org/vt.html,,44.37554,-72.87605,"How to get there : From Waterbury, follow RT 2 west approximately 6.5 miles from the intersection of RT 2 and RT 100 in Waterbury. Take a right onto Bolton Valley Road. The parking area is 0.25 miles on the right.

How to act when you are there : Be careful when you are parking or pulling out of the parking spots. The dirt and gravel are very loose and spinouts accelerate erosion. Do not use the driveways on private property to park or turn around. (Would you want hundreds of people turning around in your driveway every weekend?) Use your own bathroom before you visit. This beautiful swimming hole is heavily used and simply cannot accommodate the bathroom needs of a crowd. Yes, it is a natural thing, but when so many people leave their waste here, it turns this bucolic place into a cesspool. If you cannot find a safe place to park, try visiting one of the other swimming holes in Vermont that are listed on this page.",
